            The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—a.k.a. "things"—that are embedded
            with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other
            devices and systems over the Internet.[1][2][3][4]

            Things have evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning,
            ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.[1] Traditional fields of embedded systems,
            wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others
            all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous
            with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as
            lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support
            one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as
            smartphones and smart speakers. The IoT can also be used in healthcare systems.[5]

            There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of the IoT, especially in the areas of
            privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun
            including the development of international standards.
            The main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coca-Cola
            vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first ARPANET-connected appliance,[6] able to
            report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold or not.[7] Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on
            ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and
            PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IOT.[8][9] In 1994, Reza Raji described the concept in IEEE
            Spectrum as "[moving] small packets of data to a large set of nodes, so as to integrate and automate
            everything from home appliances to entire factories".[10] Between 1993 and 1997, several companies proposed
            solutions like Microsoft's at Work or Novell's NEST. The field gained momentum when Bill Joy envisioned
            device-to-device communication as a part of his "Six Webs" framework, presented at the World Economic Forum
            at Davos in 1999.[11]

            The concept of the "Internet of Things" and the term itself, first appeared in a speech by Peter T. Lewis,
            to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 15th Annual Legislative Weekend in Washington, D.C, published
            in September 1985.[12] According to Lewis, "The Internet of Things, or IoT, is the integration of people,
            processes and technology with connectable devices and sensors to enable remote monitoring, status,
            manipulation and evaluation of trends of such devices."

            The term "Internet of things" was coined independently by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT's
            Auto-ID Center, in 1999,[13] though he prefers the phrase "Internet for things".[14] At that point, he
            viewed radio-frequency identification (RFID) as essential to the Internet of things,[15] which would allow
            computers to manage all individual things.[16][17][18]The main theme of the Internet of Things is to embed
            short-range mobile transceivers in various gadgets and daily necessities to enable new forms of
            communication between people and things, and between things themselves.[19]

            Defining the Internet of things as "simply the point in time when more 'things or objects' were connected to
            the Internet than people", Cisco Systems estimated that the IoT was "born" between 2008 and 2009, with the
            things/people ratio growing from 0.08 in 2003 to 1.84 in 2010.

            A growing portion of IoT devices are created for consumer use, including connected vehicles, home
            automation, wearable technology, connected health, and appliances with remote monitoring capabilities.
            IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and air
            conditioning, media and security systems and camera systems.[25][26] Long-term benefits could include energy
            savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off or by making the residents in the
            home aware of usage.[27]

            A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and
            appliances.[28] For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and
            accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.[29][30] This
            could be a dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri.[31] This can be demonstrated in the case
            of Lenovo's Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple's
            Home app or Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.[31] There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are
            offered as standalone platforms to connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo,
            Google Home, Apple's HomePod, and Samsung's SmartThings Hub.[32] In addition to the commercial systems,
            there are many non-proprietary, open source ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz.
            One key application of a smart home is to provide assistance for those with disabilities and elderly
            individuals. These home systems use assistive technology to accommodate an owner's specific
            disabilities.[35] Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can
            be connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearing-impaired users.[36] They can also be equipped
            with additional safety features. These features can include sensors that monitor for medical emergencies
            such as falls or seizures.[37] Smart home technology applied in this way can provide users with more freedom
            and a higher quality of life.[35]

            The term "Enterprise IoT" refers to devices used in business and corporate settings. By 2019, it is
            estimated that the EIoT will account for 9.1 billion devices.

            Also known as IIoT, industrial IoT devices acquire and analyze data from connected equipment, operational
            technology (OT), locations, and people. Combined with operational technology (OT) monitoring devices, IIoT
            helps regulate and monitor industrial systems. Also, the same implementation can be carried out for
            automated record updates of asset placement in industrial storage units as the size of the assets can vary
            from a small screw to the whole motor spare part, and misplacement of such assets can cause a percentile
            loss of manpower time and money.
            The IoT can connect various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing, identification, processing,
            communication, actuation, and networking capabilities.[62] Network control and management of manufacturing
            equipment, asset and situation management, or manufacturing process control allow IoT to be used for
            industrial applications and smart manufacturing.[63] IoT intelligent systems enable rapid manufacturing and
            optimization of new products, and rapid response to product demands.[46]

            Digital control systems to automate process controls, operator tools and service information systems to
            optimize plant safety and security are within the purview of the IIoT.[64] IoT can also be applied to asset
            management via predictive maintenance, statistical evaluation, and measurements to maximize reliability.[65]
            Industrial management systems can be integrated with smart grids, enabling energy optimization.
            Measurements, automated controls, plant optimization, health and safety management, and other functions are
            provided by networked sensors.[46]

            In addition to general manufacturing, IoT is also used for processes in the industrialization of
            construction.[
            There are numerous IoT applications in farming[67] such as collecting data on temperature, rainfall,
            humidity, wind speed, pest infestation, and soil content. This data can be used to automate farming
            techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, minimise risk and waste, and reduce
            effort required to manage crops. For example, farmers can now monitor soil temperature and moisture from
            afar, and even apply IoT-acquired data to precision fertilisation programs.[68]

            In August 2018, Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the
            Microsoft Azure application suite for IoT technologies related to water management. Developed in part by
            researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the
            number of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow
            from the data the fish provide. The specific computer programs used in the process fall under the Azure
            Machine Learning and the Azure IoT Hub platforms.

        Security is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology,[196] with concerns that rapid
        development is happening without appropriate consideration of the profound security challenges involved[197] and
        the regulatory changes that might be necessary.[198][199]

        Most of the technical security concerns are similar to those of conventional servers, workstations and
        smartphones.[200] These concerns include using weak authentication, forgetting to change default credentials,
        unencrypted messages sent between devices, SQL injections, Man-in-the-middle attacks, and poor handling of
        security updates.[201][202] However, many IoT devices have severe operational limitations on the computational
        power available to them. These constraints often make them unable to directly use basic security measures such
        as implementing firewalls or using strong cryptosystems to encrypt their communications with other devices[203]
        - and the low price and consumer focus of many devices makes a robust security patching system uncommon.[204]

        Internet of Things devices also have access to new areas of data, and can often control physical devices,[205]
        so that even by 2014 it was possible to say that many Internet-connected appliances could already "spy on people
        in their own homes" including televisions, kitchen appliances,[206] cameras, and thermostats.[207]
        Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine, locks, hood and trunk releases, horn, heat,
        and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the on-board network. In some
        cases, vehicle computer systems are Internet-connected, allowing them to be exploited remotely.[208] By 2008
        security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority. Later hackers
        demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps[209] and implantable cardioverter defibrillators.
